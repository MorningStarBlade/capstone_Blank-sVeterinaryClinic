    <h3>Dr.Blank</h3>
    <p>Here is out lead veterinarian Dr. Blank! He is great with pets of all types, well, except for any reptile, those go to Dave. Dr. Blank went to the most prestegous school for any veterinarian, <a href="https://www.wkkellogg.com/en-us/our-foods/our-brands/rice-krispies.html">UC Davis</a>.</p>

    <h3>Dave</h3>
    <p>We honestly don't know anything about Dave, only that he comes in on Tuesdays and takes care of the lizards, because Dr.Blank said and I quote, "Lizards creep me out, just like Dave."</p>
